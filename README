UPDATE: WE'RE LIVE!!! go to https://market.android.com/details?id=com.manero.melodrone and you can download it. i published it in a hurry with the help of the always awesome marcos, and now that i've been to google developer day: são paulo, i feel kinda dirty for having done it so hastily and carelessly. the google market page needs more love.


IT'S THE INSTRUMENT OF THE FUTURE! IT'S _MELODRONE_!

well it's a small programming challenge i imposed on myself.

the idea is straight ripped from this: http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix

most of the android base work i got from @silveira's Clover project at http://github.com/silveira/Clover

i went with an 8-bit-esque sound approach because it looks shitty. so when i showed it to a friend and asked him to create the sound files, he said "do you want me to do 8-bit-esque sounds to go with the 8-bit look?", lmao.

so thanks, dudes.

i generated all the sound files myself using audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).

there are bugs, of course. don't know if i'll fix them or if i'll just waste my life playing starcraft2. probably the latter.
